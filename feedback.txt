Anastacia: Volunteers matching
Ellegant and pythonic project!
The structure is well organized, the code is clean and easy to follow.
You implemented OOP in the best way, using classes and decorators, connecting the files like a pro!
I love that you used all the concepts that we learned (besides JSON), even adding a weather API.
That's the mindset!
Congrats! It is a really beautiful and professional project!
